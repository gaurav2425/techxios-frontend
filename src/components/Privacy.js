          <h3>Privacy policy</h3>

          <h4>
            This privacy policy describes how the personally identifiable
            information ("Personal Information") you may provide on the
            techxios.com website and any of its related products and services
            (collectively, "Services") is collected, protected and used. It also
            describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your
            Personal Information and how you can access and update this
            information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you
            ("User", "you" or "your") and this Website operator ("Operator",
            "we", "us" or "our"). By accessing and using the Website and
            Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree
            to be bound by the terms of this Policy. This Policy does not apply
            to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to
            individuals that we do not employ or manage. This privacy policy was
            created with the help of the privacy policy generator.

          <h3>Collection of information</h3>
          <h4>
            Our top priority is customer data security and, as such, we exercise
            the no logs policy. We may process only minimal user data, only as
            much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website and
            Services. Information collected automatically is used only to
            identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical
            information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and
            Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated
            in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.

          <h3>Use and processing of collected information</h3>
          <h4>
            In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to
            meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain
            Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we
            request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested
            products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may
            be used for the following purposes:

          <h4>
            <div>
              <li>Request user feedback</li>
              <li>Improve user experience</li>

              <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>

          </h4>

          <br></br>
          <h4>
            Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact
            with the Website and Services, where you are located in the world
            and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent
            for one or more specific purposes; this, however, does not apply,
            whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to
            European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is
            necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for
            any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is
            necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are
            subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in
            the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested
            in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the
            legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.
            <br></br>
            Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process
            information until you object to such processing (by opting out),
            without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
            legal bases below. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the
            specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
            particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a
            statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to
            enter into a contract.

          <h3>Disclosure of information</h3>
          <h4>
            Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any
            transaction or provide any service you have requested, we may share
            your information with your consent with our trusted third parties
            that work with us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely
            upon to assist in the operation of the Website and Services
            available to you. We do not share Personal Information with
            unaffiliated third parties. These service providers are not
            authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary
            to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements.
            We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with
            third parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who
            agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information.
            These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in
            order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize
            them to use or disclose Personal Information for their own marketing
            or other purposes.

          <br></br>
          <h3>Do Not Track signals</h3>
          <h4>
            Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
            websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
            tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
            in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
            collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who
            use or visit a website or online service as they move across
            different websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not
            Track signal is not yet uniform. As a result, the Website and
            Services are not yet set up to interpret or respond to Do Not Track
            signals communicated by your browser. Even so, as described in more
            detail throughout this Policy, we limit our use and collection of
            your personal information.

            not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not
            responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or

            Website and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and
            every resource that may collect Personal Information.
